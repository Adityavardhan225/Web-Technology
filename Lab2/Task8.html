    The ancient Chinese game of Go has more possible moves than the number of atoms in the universe. Unlike chess, Go cannot be won using brute-force computing power to analyze a lot of moves — there are just too many possibilities. And, unlike chess, strategies for winning Go cannot be meaningfully codified by rules: its principles are mysterious. In some cultures, Go is seen as a way for humans to connect with the divine via instances of intuition, by “knowing without knowing how you know.”

Experts believed that computers would not be able to defeat top human players at Go for decades, if ever. But in 2016, a computer program called AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the legendary world champion of Go (1). During the games, AlphaGo played highly inventively, making moves that no human ever would, and defeated the 18-time world champion four games to one.

AlphaGo is an artificial intelligence (AI) program built using deep learning technologies. From self-driving cars to lawyer-bots (2), deep learning is fueling what many believe will be the biggest technology revolution the world has seen. “Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don’t think AI will transform in the next several years,” says Andrew Ng, who has held positions as Director of the Stanford AI Lab, Chief Scientist of Baidu, and Founder of Google Brain.

Chemical engineers routinely use computers for modeling, simulation, design, and optimization of chemical processes. Typically, the computational methods are numerical algorithms (i.e., regression, statistics, differential equations, etc.) performed with software tools like Excel, MatLab, AspenPlus, CHEMCAD, COMSOL Multiphysics, etc. All of these methods and tools are applications of well-known chemical engineering principles, which the engineer combines and applies intelligently to solve high-level problems. Could computers do more than mere computation and someday solve high-level problems like a chemical engineer?

“The vision is that you’ll be able to walk up to a system and say, ‘I want to make this molecule.’ The software will tell you the route you should make it from, and the machine will make it,” says Klavs Jensen, the Warren K. Lewis Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT (3). His research uses deep learning to identify a pathway to transform a set of available reactants into a target compound (4). Outside academia, deep learning is already being used by practicing engineers to solve a whole range of previously intractable problems and may become as valuable as Excel to chemical engineers in the future.
